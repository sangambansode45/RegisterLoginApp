Welcome Back Developers!
In this Application, we will cover the essential steps for creating Login and SignUp screens using SwiftUI in Xcode 14
1. Designing the Unique Sign-In Screen:
Background Shape:
Create a visually appealing background for the view.
Use gradient colors or a custom shape for the background.
2. Building a Custom TextField in SwiftUI:
Dynamic Values for TextField:
Pass values like icon and placeholder dynamically to customize the TextField.
Icons (e.g., lock for password, envelope for email).
Placeholders (e.g., "Email", "Password").
3. Creating Dynamic Sign-In and Sign-Up Buttons:
Custom Buttons:
Design reusable and customizable Sign-In and Sign-Up buttons.
Buttons should trigger dynamic actions based on user input.
4. Implementing Login with Facebook and Google:
Social Login Integration:
Add Facebook Login and Google Login buttons.
5. Designing the Sign-Up Screen UI in SwiftUI 4:
Sign-Up Form:
Design the Sign-Up screen with necessary fields (e.g., Email, Password, Confirm Password).
Use the same dynamic TextField design for consistency.
Add clear call-to-action buttons like Sign-Up.
6. Adding Navigation Links to Buttons:
NavigationLink:
Link the Sign-In and Sign-Up screens using Navigation Link.
Enable smooth navigation between forms with a simple tap.
